# ZaneyOS 2.3 → 2.4 Upgrade Guide

This guide provides safe upgrade scripts to migrate from ZaneyOS 2.3 to 2.4, handling all the breaking changes and ensuring your custom configuration is preserved.

## 🔄 Major Changes in 2.4

- **SDDM** is now the default display manager (was previously tui-greetd)
- **Terminal Selection**: Individual terminal applications can be enabled/disabled
- **New Variables**: Additional configuration variables added to `variables.nix`
- **Breaking Changes**: Direct upgrade causes build failures due to missing variables

## 📋 What the Upgrade Script Does

1. **Pre-Upgrade Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of your current configuration with detailed report
2. **Full Backup**: Creates complete backup of your current system
3. **Version Verification**: Confirms you're running ZaneyOS 2.3
4. **Safe Upgrade**: Switches to main branch (2.4) and merges configurations
5. **Variable Merging**: Automatically migrates all your settings to new format
6. **Terminal Handling**: Ensures your preferred terminal is enabled in 2.4
7. **Safe Build**: Uses `boot` option to avoid SDDM display issues
8. **Revert Option**: Provides easy rollback if anything goes wrong

## 🛡️ Safety Features

- **Complete Backup**: Full copy of your zaneyos directory before any changes
- **Boot vs Switch**: Uses safe boot option to prevent display manager conflicts
- **Revert Function**: Can completely restore 2.3 backup with one command
- **Validation**: Checks system state before proceeding
- **Logging**: Comprehensive log file for troubleshooting

## 🚀 How to Upgrade

### Step 0: Get the upgrade script safely (do NOT git pull yet)

To avoid overwriting your local configuration before a backup is created, fetch just the upgrade script without modifying your working tree.

Option A — Using your existing git remote (recommended):
```bash
# Fetch the latest refs without touching your working tree
git -C ~/zaneyos fetch origin

# Write the script from origin/main into your home directory
git -C ~/zaneyos show origin/main:upgrade-2.3-to-2.4.sh > ~/upgrade-2.3-to-2.4.sh
chmod +x ~/upgrade-2.3-to-2.4.sh
```

Option B — Using curl (if you don't have a usable origin remote):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://gitlab.com/zaney/zaneyos/-/raw/main/upgrade-2.3-to-2.4.sh -o ~/upgrade-2.3-to-2.4.sh
chmod +x ~/upgrade-2.3-to-2.4.sh
```

Both methods keep your local repo unchanged. The script will create a full backup before switching branches.

### Step 1: Run the Upgrade Script

```bash
# You can run the script from anywhere; it operates on ~/zaneyos
~/upgrade-2.3-to-2.4.sh
```

### Step 2: Review the Pre-Upgrade Analysis

The script will first perform a comprehensive analysis of your current configuration:
- **Analyze flake.nix** for custom inputs and current profile
- **Scan all host configurations** and detect customizations
- **Check global packages** in modules/core/packages.nix
- **Detect shell customizations** (zsh, bash, eza personal files)
- **Identify other custom modules** and personal files
- **Generate a detailed report** saved as `~/zaneyos-upgrade-analysis-TIMESTAMP.txt`

**The analysis will clearly show:**
- ✅ **What WILL be automatically migrated** (variables, packages, configs)
- ⚠️ **What requires manual attention** (custom inputs, personal shell files)
- 📋 **Summary of all hosts and customizations** found

### Step 3: Follow the Prompts

After reviewing the analysis, the script will:
- Create a backup (you'll see the location)
- Ask for confirmation before proceeding
- Download ZaneyOS 2.4 from main branch
- Merge your configuration automatically
- Build the new system
- Prompt for reboot

### Step 4: Reboot Your System

After successful build:
```bash
sudo reboot
```

Your system will now boot with:
- SDDM as the login manager
- All your previous settings preserved
- New 2.4 features available

## 🔧 Configuration Migration Details

### Automatically Preserved Settings:
- Git username and email
- Browser preference
- Terminal choice (with automatic enabling)
- Keyboard layout and console keymap
- NFS, printing, and Thunar settings
- Clock format (12h/24h)
- Monitor settings
- Wallpaper (stylixImage)
- Waybar theme choice
- Animation settings
- Hardware configuration
- **Global packages** (modules/core/packages.nix customizations)
- **Host-specific packages** (hosts/[hostname]/host-packages.nix)
- **Custom module imports** (hosts/[hostname]/default.nix if customized)

### Terminal Handling:
If you were using a specific terminal in 2.3:
- **Kitty**: Already enabled by default in 2.4
- **Alacritty**: Script automatically enables `alacrittyEnable = true`
- **WezTerm**: Script automatically enables `weztermEnable = true`
- **Ghostty**: Script automatically enables `ghosttyEnable = true`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### SDDM Display Manager
- 2.4 uses SDDM as default login manager
- The upgrade uses `boot` instead of `switch` to prevent display issues
- You **must reboot** after upgrade - don't use `switch` command

### Backup Location
Your backup is stored at:
```
~/.config/zaneyos-backups/zaneyos-2.3-upgrade-backup-TIMESTAMP/
```

## 🔄 How to Revert

If you encounter any issues, you can easily revert:

### Option 1: Use the Revert Script
```bash
cd ~/zaneyos
./revert-to-2.3.sh
```

### Option 2: Use the Main Script
```bash
cd ~/zaneyos
./upgrade-2.3-to-2.4.sh --revert
```

### Option 3: Manual Revert
1. Remove current zaneyos directory: `rm -rf ~/zaneyos`
2. Restore from backup: `cp -r ~/.config/zaneyos-backups/[backup-name]/zaneyos ~/`
3. Rebuild system: `nh os boot ~/zaneyos --hostname [profile]`
4. Reboot system

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
- Check the log file (location shown in script output)
- Ensure you have sufficient disk space
- Try the revert option and report the issue

### Display Issues After Reboot
- If you get a blank screen, wait a few moments for SDDM to start
- You can switch to TTY (Ctrl+Alt+F2) if needed
- Login and run `systemctl status display-manager`

### Missing Applications
- Check if your preferred terminal is enabled in `~/zaneyos/hosts/[hostname]/variables.nix`
- Verify browser and other applications are still available
- Some applications may need to be re-enabled in the new configuration

### Log File Location
Each run creates a log file at: `~/zaneyos-upgrade-TIMESTAMP.log`

## 📁 File Structure After Upgrade

Your host configuration will be updated with new 2.4 structure:
```
~/zaneyos/hosts/[your-hostname]/
├── hardware.nix          (preserved from 2.3)
└── variables.nix         (updated to 2.4 format with your settings)
```

## 🆘 Emergency Recovery

If something goes very wrong:
1. Your complete 2.3 backup is preserved
2. Boot from NixOS live USB if needed
3. Mount your system and restore the backup
4. All your data and configuration is safe

## ✅ Post-Upgrade Checklist

- [ ] SDDM login screen appears
- [ ] Desktop environment loads correctly
- [ ] Preferred terminal opens and works
- [ ] Browser launches correctly
- [ ] Custom wallpaper/theme preserved
- [ ] Monitor configuration correct
- [ ] All needed applications available

## 🤝 Getting Help
