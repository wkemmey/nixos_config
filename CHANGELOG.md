## 🗒️ Changelog


**ZaneyOS v2.3**

 - **Updated** `zaneyos/modules/home/nvf.nix`
  - **A recent NeoVIM update:** disables `vim.lspines` (Part of LSP diagnostics)
  - **Because of that we enabled** `vim.diagnostics`
  - **As a result**, you have to toggle on diagnostic messages
    - `leader dt` to toggle on/off  
    - **Keybindings for diagnostics:**  

```toml
{
          key = "<leader>dj";
          mode = ["n"];
          action = "<cmd>Lspsaga diagnostic_jump_next<CR>";
          desc = "Go to next diagnostic";
        }
        {
          key = "<leader>dk";
          mode = ["n"];
          action = "<cmd>Lspsaga diagnostic_jump_prev<CR>";
          desc = "Go to previous diagnostic";
        }
        {
          key = "<leader>dl";
          mode = ["n"];
          action = "<cmd>Lspsaga show_line_diagnostics<CR>";
          desc = "Show diagnostic details";
        }
        {
          key = "<leader>dt";
          mode = ["n"];
          action = "<cmd>Trouble diagnostics toggle<cr>";
          desc = "Toggle diagnostics list";
        }

**ZaneyOS v2.1**

 Simple bug fixes.

- Fixed Waybar icons to make them look a bit better.
- Centered the Wofi window always.
- Should have fixed some Steam issues, but I have had some crashes due to Steam
  so be aware of that.
- The flake got an update, so all the packages are fresh.


**ZaneyOS v2.0**

With this new update of ZaneyOS it is a big rewrite of how things are being
done. This update fixes many issues that you guys were facing. As well as makes
things a little easier to understand. You now have a lot being stored inside the
specific host directory, making use of modules, condensing seperate files down,
etc. My hope is that with this update your ability to grasp the flake and expand
it to what you need is much improved. I want to thank everyone for being so
supportive!

- Most configuration put into specific hosts directories for the best
  portability.
- Using modules to condense configuration complexity.
- Simplified options and the complexity around understanding their
  implementation.
- Rewrote the documentation for improved readability.
