### Installation

Black Don OS installs directly on your hardware, replacing or dual-booting with your existing system.

> **📝 Note:** Don't be intimidated by the steps below! The process is straightforward:
> 1. Boot NixOS ISO → Install base NixOS → Reboot
> 2. Run Black Don OS installer → Reboot
> 3. Done! The whole process takes about 30-45 minutes.

#### Step 1: Create NixOS Installation Media
1. Download the **GNOME ISO** from [nixos.org/download](https://nixos.org/download)
   - Choose "GNOME, 64-bit Intel/AMD" under "Graphical ISO image"
2. Create a bootable USB drive with the ISO using:
   - [Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) (Windows/Mac/Linux)
   - [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) (Windows)
   - `dd` command (Linux)
3. Boot your computer from the USB drive

#### Step 2: Install Base NixOS System
1. **Boot from the NixOS ISO** - you'll see the GNOME desktop
2. **Connect to WiFi** (if needed) using the network icon in the top-right corner
3. **Open the NixOS installer**:
   - Double-click the "Install NixOS" icon on the desktop
   - Or search for "Calamares" in the application menu

4. **Follow the graphical installer**:
   - **Welcome**: Select your language
   - **Location**: Choose your timezone
   - **Keyboard**: Select your keyboard layout
   - **Partitions**: Choose how to set up your disk
     - "Erase disk" for a clean install (recommended for beginners)
     - "Manual partitioning" for advanced users or dual-boot
   - **Users**: Create your username and password
   - **Summary**: Review your choices
   - **Install**: Click "Install" and wait (takes 10-15 minutes)

5. **Reboot into your new NixOS system**:
   - Click "Restart now" when installation completes
   - Remove the USB drive when prompted

#### Step 3: Install Black Don OS
1. **Log in to your new NixOS system** with the user you created

2. **Open a terminal** (press `Super` key and type "terminal")

3. **Install required tools**:
   ```bash
   nix-shell -p git pciutils
   ```

4. **Clone and run the Black Don OS installer**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/theblackdon/black-don-os
   cd black-don-os
   ./install.sh
   ```

The installer will:
- ✅ Detect your hardware automatically
- ✅ Ask for hostname and username (only 3 questions!)
- ✅ Generate hardware configuration
- ✅ Build and install Black Don OS
- ✅ Set up both Hyprland and Niri window managers

5. **Reboot to complete installation**:
   ```bash
   reboot
   ```

**That's it!** After the final reboot, you'll see the SDDM login screen where you can:
- Log in with your username
- Choose between Hyprland or Niri from the session menu
- Enjoy your new Black Don OS desktop!

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Adding a New Computer

To install Black Don OS on another computer:

1. Clone the repo on the new machine
2. Run `./install.sh` with a different hostname
3. Your configurations are kept separate in `hosts/`

### Multiple Hosts

Each computer gets its own directory under `hosts/`:
- `hosts/my-desktop/` - Your desktop configuration
- `hosts/my-laptop/` - Your laptop configuration

They can have completely different settings, packages, and features enabled.

### Updating Your System

```bash
cd ~/black-don-os
dcli pull      # Pull latest changes
dcli update    # Update flake inputs and rebuild
# or use the alias:
fu             # Fast update
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

If the build fails, try:
```bash
# Generate diagnostic report
dcli diag

# Rebuild with detailed output
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ~/black-don-os#YOUR-HOSTNAME --show-trace
```

### Monitor Not Working

Update your monitor settings in `hosts/YOUR-HOSTNAME/variables.nix`:
```bash
# Find your monitors
hyprctl monitors  # (after first login)

# Update extraMonitorSettings with correct output names
```

### NVIDIA Prime Not Working

For hybrid laptops, find your GPU IDs:
```bash
lspci | grep VGA

# Update intelID and nvidiaID in variables.nix
```

### Hyprlock Conflicting with Other Lock Screens

If using Noctalia lock screens:
```nix
enableHyprlock = false;  # in variables.nix
```

## 🛠️ dcli - Don's CLI Tool

Black Don OS includes `dcli`, a powerful command-line utility for managing your system:

### Quick Commands
```bash
dcli rebuild      # Rebuild current system
dcli update       # Update and rebuild
dcli list-hosts   # List available configurations
dcli cleanup      # Remove old generations
dcli diag         # Generate diagnostic report

# Convenient aliases
fr                # Fast rebuild (dcli rebuild)
fu                # Fast update (dcli update)
```

See [dcli.md](dcli.md) for complete documentation.

## 💡 Tips for NixOS Newcomers

- **Use dcli commands** - Simpler than remembering nixos-rebuild syntax
- **Everything is declarative** - Your entire system is defined in text files
- **Rebuilding is safe** - If something breaks, boot into the previous generation
- **No reinstall needed** - Just edit files and rebuild with `fr`
- **Git is your friend** - Use `dcli commit` to track your configuration changes
- **Read the variables** - Most customization happens in `variables.nix`
