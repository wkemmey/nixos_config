#### 🍖 Requirements

- You must be running on NixOS, version 23.11+. 
- The zaneyos folder (this repo) is expected to be in your home directory.
- Must have installed using **GPT** & **UEFI**. Systemd-boot is what is supported, for
  GRUB you will have to brave the internet for a how-to. ☺️
- Manually editing your host specific files. The host is the specific computer
  your installing on.

#### 🎹 Pipewire & Notification Menu Controls

- We are using the latest and greatest audio solution for Linux. Not to mention
  you will have media and volume controls in the notification center available
  in the top bar.

#### 🏇 Optimized Workflow & Simple Yet Elegant Neovim

- Using Hyprland for increased elegance, functionality, and effeciency.
- No massive Neovim project here. This is my simple, easy to understand, yet
  incredible Neovim setup.

#### 🖥️ Multi Host & User Configuration

- You can define separate settings for different host machines and users.
- Easily specify extra packages for your users in the modules/core/user.nix
  file.
- Easy to understand file structure and simple, but encompassing, configuration.

#### 👼 An Incredible Community Focused On Support

- The entire idea of ZaneyOS is to make NixOS an approachable space that is
  actually a great community that you want to be in.
- Many people who are patient and happy to spend their free time helping you are
  running ZaneyOS. Feel free to reach out on the Discord for any help with
  anything.

#### 📦 How To Install Packages?

- You can search the [Nix Packages](https://search.nixos.org/packages?) &
  [Options](https://search.nixos.org/options?) pages for what a package may be
  named or if it has options available that take care of configuration hurdles
  you may face.
- To add a package there are the sections for it in `modules/core/packages.nix`
  and `modules/core/user.nix`. One is for programs available system wide and the
  other for your users environment only.

## ⬇️ Install

Don't forget to checkout the [FAQ](https://zaney.org/wiki/zaneyos-2.3/faq)

### 📜 Script:

This is the easiest and recommended way of starting out. The script is not meant
to allow you to change every option that you can in the flake or help you
install extra packages. It is simply here so you can get my configuration
installed with as little chances of breakages and then fiddle to your hearts
content!

Simply copy this and run it:

![ZaneyOS First Install Command](img/first-install-cmd.jpg)

```
nix-shell -p git curl pciutils 
```

Then:

![ZaneyOS Install Script Command](img/install-script.jpg)

```
sh <(curl -L https://gitlab.com/Zaney/zaneyos/-/raw/stable-2.3/install-zaneyos.sh)
```

#### The install process will look something like this:

![First Part Of Install](img/1.jpg)

![Second Part Of Install](img/2.jpg)

#### After the install completes your environment will probably look broken. Just reboot and you will see this as your login:

![Display Manager](img/3.jpg)

#### Then after login you should see a screen like this:

![Desktop Example](img/4.jpg)

#### 🦽 Manual:

1. Run this command to ensure Git & Vim are installed:

```
nix-shell -p git vim
```

2. Clone this repo & enter it:

```
cd && git clone -b stable-2.3 --single-branch https://gitlab.com/Zaney/zaneyos.git
cd zaneyos
```

- _You should stay in this folder for the rest of the install_

3. Create the host folder for your machine(s) like so:

```
cp -r hosts/default hosts/<your-desired-hostname>
```

4. Edit `hosts/<your-desired-hostname>/variables.nix`.

5. Edit `flake.nix` and fill in your username, profile, and hostname.

6. Generate your hardware.nix like so:

```
nixos-generate-config --show-hardware-config > hosts/<your-desired-hostname>/hardware.nix
```

7. Run this to enable flakes and install the flake replacing hostname with
   whatever you put as the hostname:

```
NIX_CONFIG="experimental-features = nix-command flakes" 
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#profile
```

Now when you want to rebuild the configuration you have access to an alias
called `fr` that will rebuild the flake and you do not have to be in the
`zaneyos` folder for it to work.

Hope you enjoy!
